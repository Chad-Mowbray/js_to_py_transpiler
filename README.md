A toy to experiment with converting a JavaScript file to a Python one.  

```bash
./runner.sh
```

Some Rules for JavaScript origin (so far):
1. must use spaces
2. functions, etc. must go on single line
3. parameters must not contain spaces


Can handle (so far):
1. variable assignment
2. basic math operators
3. basic functions
4. basic for loops
5. object creation
6. object property access
